# KeyAuth-JAVA-API

KeyAuth Java Api/Example for For The https://keyauth.com Authentication system.

I decided to make an api for java simply because there were none.
Example that I used - [KeyAuth-CSHARP-Example](https://github.com/KeyAuth/KeyAuth-CSHARP-Example)

**Information**
There is no encryption for sent requests and iv keys
I guess I just don't know how to make them right
